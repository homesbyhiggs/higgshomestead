owner_content:
  - "Justin Highland 'Higgs' has worn many hats over the years and used his wide range of abilities to build Higgs Homestead into what you see today. He built the 'Modern Tiny Home' almost exclusively by himselfâ€”foundation to kitchen cabinets were all his doing, except for help on days when there simply was no safe way to do it alone."
  - "Beyond running the homestead, Justin is passionate about making home ownership more attainable. He believes that with the right guidance and determination, more people can achieve the dream of building their own home. Prior to devoting himself full time to realizing the potential of the homestead, he was a real estate agent and health physicist for the state of Texas."
