**Howdy and welcome to our little corner of the internet!** 

I'm Justin, and along with my mother Julie, we've been building something pretty special here at Higgs Homestead. What started as a base for Julie's equine therapy non-profit has grown into a one-of-a-kind micro resort where folks can experience authentic farm life just 20 minutes from downtown Fort Worth.

## Why Start a Blog?

After countless conversations with guests about our building methods, animal care, and the realities of homestead life, I realized there's a hunger for real, honest stories about this lifestyle. Not the polished Instagram version, but the actual day-to-day experiencesâ€”the victories, the challenges, and everything in between.

## What You Can Expect

This blog will be your behind-the-scenes pass to homestead life. I'll be sharing:

### Building Projects & Methods
- **Real construction experiences** from our four different building approaches
- **Cost breakdowns** and honest timelines 
- **Mistakes I made** so you don't have to repeat them
- **Tool recommendations** from someone who's actually used them

### Farm Life Stories
- **Daily animal care** routines and personalities
- **Seasonal challenges** and how we handle them
- **Guest interactions** with our farm friends
- **The reality** of free-range chickens (spoiler: they have opinions about everything)

### Homesteading Tips
- **Practical advice** for beginners
- **Equipment that's worth it** vs. expensive mistakes
- **Time management** when you're wearing twelve different hats
- **Making it financially sustainable**

## The Promise

I'm not here to sell you a dream or make homesteading look easier than it is. This life requires work, involves setbacks, and sometimes the chickens will judge your life choices. But it's also incredibly rewarding, and if you're considering this path, you deserve honest information from someone who's living it.

Whether you're a current guest planning your visit, someone considering the homestead life, or just curious about how we turned 10 acres into a working farm and micro resort, I'm glad you're here.

## What's Coming Next

In upcoming posts, I'll be diving into:
- The real cost and timeline of building our Modern Tiny Home
- Why Ginger (our Highland cow) is basically the farm's HR department
- Container home conversion: what I wish I'd known before starting
- The Great Chicken Coop Redesign of 2024
