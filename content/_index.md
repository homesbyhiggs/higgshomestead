# About Higgs Homestead

**Howdy!** We are a one-of-a-kind micro resort where rustic charm meets modern comfort. Nestled on a scenic farmstead just outside Fort Worth, we offer a peaceful retreat with friendly farm animals and cozy accommodations.

Wake up to the quiet of the countryside, sip your morning coffee while curious chickens roam, say hello to Ginger our Highland cow, and feed treats to Snickerdoodle our spirited mini-horse. You can even ask the owner all your homesteading related questions.

* **Nearly 10 Acres** - Space to roam and escape the everyday
* **Perfect Location** - Less than 30 minutes to Downtown Fort Worth, Dickies Arena, AT&T Stadium and The Stockyards
* **Personal Service** - On-site owners who facilitate all animal interactions and provide extraordinary hospitality
