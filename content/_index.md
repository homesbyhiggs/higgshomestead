# About Higgs Homestead

**Howdy!** We are a one-of-a-kind micro resort where rustic charm meets modern comfort. Nestled on a scenic farmstead just outside Fort Worth, we offer a peaceful retreat with friendly farm animals and cozy accommodations perfect for both vacationers and staycationers. Wake up to the quiet of the countryside, sip your morning coffee as curious chickens roam the property, and say hello to Ginger, our lovable Highland cow. Snickerdoodle, our spirited mini-horse, is always ready for a snack and some attention.

* **Nearly 10 Acres** - Space to roam and escape the everyday
* **Perfect Location** - Less than 30 minutes to Downtown Fort Worth, Dickies Arena, AT&T Stadium and The Stockyards
* **Personal Service** - On-site owners who facilitate all animal interactions and provide extraordinary hospitality
